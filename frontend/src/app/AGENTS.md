# Frontend Architecture Instructions

These rules apply to Angular app code under `frontend/src/app/**/*.ts`.

## Layer Structure

```text
frontend/src/app/
├── core/          # App-wide infrastructure only
├── shared/ui/     # Reusable primitives (only if 2+ features need it)
└── features/      # Feature modules — all domain code lives here
```

## Strict Import Rules

Never violate these boundaries:

- `core/` must not import from `features/` or `shared/ui/`.
- `features/<a>/` must not import from `features/<b>/`.
- `shared/ui/` must not import from `features/` or `core/`.
- Feature services must not inject `HttpClient` directly; use `ApiClient` from `core/http/`.
- When one feature needs data that is also used by another feature, do not import that other
  feature's service or model just for convenience. Add a small feature-owned service/model over the
  shared backend endpoint, or move a genuinely reusable primitive to an allowed shared layer.

## `core/` Contents

## I18n

- Runtime i18n is loaded once on app startup from the backend: request available languages first,
  then request the selected language bundle.
- Public prefixed routes (`/ru/...` and `/en/...`) must initialize UI/content language from the URL.
  Keep legacy unprefixed routes only for compatibility/protected SPA access, not canonical SEO.
- Do not hardcode user-facing interface strings in Angular templates or components. Use
  `TranslatePipe` in templates and `I18nService.translate()` in TypeScript code.
- Persist only supported language codes returned by the backend. Do not introduce frontend-only
  languages or language fallbacks that bypass the backend enum/catalog.
- Articles and article tags localise content through the articles API, not through the UI i18n bundle. Pass
  the current `I18nService.language()` value as the explicit `language` query parameter for
  localized read requests, edit both RU/EN article and tag `translations` in authoring forms, and send
  both languages in write payloads.
- Article authoring must send an explicit `metadata` object with article create/update payloads.
  Individual metadata fields may be null. Keep SEO analysis advisory-only, keep in-form
  article/social previews derived from the active language, and do not block save/publish on SEO
  warnings. Render typed wiki links from Markdown, currently `[[articles:<slug>]]` and
  `[[matrix:<slug>]]` with optional labels such as `[[matrix:<slug>|Custom label]]`, as internal
  localized links, and only warn about missing targets when the typed target registry is known.
- Require all RU/EN article and tag translation fields in frontend forms. Do not add frontend-only
  language fallbacks for localized content.
- Competency matrix content localises through the matrix API, not through the UI i18n bundle. Pass
  the current `I18nService.language()` value as the explicit `language` query parameter for sheets,
  structure trees, item lists, item details, resource search, and create/update responses; use stable
  `sheetKey` values for public sheet selection and required `subsectionId` values for question
  create/update persistence.
- Require all RU/EN competency matrix question, answer, expected-answer, structure inline-create,
  resource-name, and resource-context fields in frontend forms. Do not reintroduce manual
  sheet/section/subsection text fields on question forms; use the admin structure picker.
  Do not add frontend-only language fallbacks for localized content.
- Resume workspace content is single-language per resume. Forms must send required `language` plus
  one content shape, must not add resume-specific RU/EN controls, and must not validate whether the
  authored text matches the selected language. Editor chrome follows the current UI bundle; resume
  preview labels should render from the saved/selected resume language using backend i18n bundles.
- Do not localise other database/content text in this layer until the backend supports that content
  explicitly.

## `shared/ui/` Rules

- Add a component here only when 2+ features already use it.
- Standalone, `OnPush`, `@Input()`/`@Output()` or signal `input()`/`output()` only — no service
  injection or feature/domain state. Keep logic UI-local.
- Current primitives: `LoadingSpinnerComponent`, `ErrorMessageComponent`, `EmptyStateComponent`,
  `LocalizedDatePickerComponent`.

## Feature Structure

Each feature owns everything it needs:

```text
features/<name>/
├── <name>.routes.ts          # Feature routes (lazy-loaded sub-routes)
├── models/                   # Interfaces and DTO mapping functions
├── services/                 # HTTP services using ApiClient
└── pages/
    └── <page-name>/
        ├── <page>.component.ts/html/scss/spec.ts
        └── components/       # Presentational components used only by this page
```

- Page components: smart — hold signals, inject services, handle loading/error/empty.
- Presentational components: dumb — `@Input()`/`@Output()` only, no injection.
- Feature models must separate backend DTOs from UI models when their shapes differ.
- Feature services own endpoint calls and DTO-to-UI mapping; components should not depend on backend DTO shape.

## Routing

- `app.routes.ts` — top-level only. Lazy-loads feature routes via `loadChildren`.
- Public canonical routes are language-prefixed. Keep `/ru/articles/:slug`, `/en/articles/:slug`,
  `/ru/how-this-site-is-built`, `/en/how-this-site-is-built`,
  `/ru/competency-matrix/questions/:slug`, and `/en/competency-matrix/questions/:slug` as SSR
  routes, and render internal article/wiki links with the active language prefix.
- Protected CSR routes such as `/admin-panel` stay unprefixed and use runtime i18n state.
- Feature `routes.ts` — owns all sub-routes for that feature (`''`, `':id'`, etc.).
- Use `loadChildren` (not `loadComponent`) so adding sub-routes never touches `app.routes.ts`.
- Apply the broad content-access guard at protected parent route level. Add stricter child guards
  only for narrower role boundaries, such as owner/admin team workspaces inside `/admin-panel`.

## `app.config.ts`

Single place for all providers:

- `provideRouter(routes, withComponentInputBinding(), withInMemoryScrolling({ anchorScrolling: 'enabled', scrollPositionRestoration: 'enabled' }))`
- `provideHttpClient(withInterceptors([authInterceptor, errorInterceptor]))` — auth interceptor always first
- `provideClientHydration(...)` with transfer cache limited to safe public GETs only. Do not transfer
  auth, account, analytics, reaction, upload, presign, or other private/side-effect endpoints.
- `{ provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: GlobalErrorHandler }`

No `AppModule`. No `NgModule` anywhere.
Keep `app.config.ts` as the only place for app-wide providers, interceptors, and global error-handler wiring.

## `app.config.server.ts` / SSR

- Server-only providers belong in `app.config.server.ts`.
- SSR API calls must rewrite relative `/api/*` URLs through the required `SSR_API_ORIGIN`
  environment variable.
- Public origin for canonical/transfer-cache mapping must come from explicit `SSR_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` or
  required `APP_URL_SCHEMA` + `APP_DOMAIN`.
- Browser-only features such as view tracking, engaged-view timers, reaction selection, downloads,
  storage-backed preferences, and content authoring interactions must not run during SSR.
- Browser-only access should go through injected Angular platform/document abstractions or narrowly
  scoped helpers. Do not read browser globals at module scope, and do not make public SSR routes
  depend on browser APIs being present.

## `ApiError` Shape

Matches `verbose_http_exceptions` backend library:

```ts
interface ApiError {
  code: string;
  type: string;
  message: string;
  location: string | null;
  attr: string | null;
  nested_errors?: ApiError[];
}
```

## What Not to Introduce

- NgRx or any global state library (unless proven necessary)
- Repository classes that only proxy `ApiClient`
- Abstract base components
- Facades over services
- Additional global state services unless 2+ features already need them
- Premature generic abstractions
